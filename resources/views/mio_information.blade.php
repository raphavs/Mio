                    <p>Mio is an access control system that allows clients to manage their doors smart via smartphone, tablet or PC.
                        To do this, clients create users and determine which person is able to open which door at which time.
                        In addition, all opening transactions are recorded in a log, which clients and users can view at any time. </p>

                    <P>It is possible to manage more than one door. So you can be a client and have all rights about your home door, for example.
                        And also a user without any rights apart from open a door. This allows you to open the office door, for example.
                        With Mio you can easily handle both of them in only one account. </P>
                    <p>Manufacturers also have their advantages with Mio.
